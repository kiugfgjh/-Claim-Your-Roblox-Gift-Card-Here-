#### **What is a Roblox Gift Card?**

A **Roblox gift card** is a prepaid card that can be used to add credit to a player's Roblox account. The balance added from a gift card can be used to purchase **Robux**, which is the virtual currency used on the platform. Robux is essential for purchasing in-game items, avatar customization, game passes, and even premium content in Roblox games. Additionally, Roblox gift cards can be used to purchase a **Roblox Premium** membership, a subscription that offers various perks, including a monthly Robux allowance, exclusive items, and the ability to trade items.

Roblox gift cards are available in two main formats:

1. **Physical Gift Cards**: These cards are sold at retail stores and online. They usually come in various denominations, such as $10, $25, $50, and $100. These cards feature a unique code that users can redeem on the Roblox website or app.
   
2. **Digital Gift Cards**: Available for purchase online, digital gift cards are delivered via email. The recipient receives a code that can be redeemed immediately for Robux or a Roblox Premium subscription.
